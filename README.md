# Machine Learning & AI Practice Test

**1. A chatbot is an AI system that holds conversations with people. In some cases, chatbots learn behaviour from the people they are talking to.

b. Thinking humanly
c. Acting rationally
d. Acting humanly

**2. Satellite navigation systems advise drivers on the best route to take through busy cities.

a. Thinking rationally
b. Thinking humanly
c. Acting humanly
d. Acting rationally

**3. The “General Problem Solver” (GPS) was an early AI system, developed around 1961. GPS could solve simple problems by applying a sequence of reasoning steps.

a. Acting humanly
b. Thinking rationally
c. Thinking humanly
d. Acting rationally

**4. Expert systems use rules expressed in logic to make decisions or recommendations (such as configuring a computer system).

b. Acting humanly
c. Thinking humanly
d. Acting rationally

c. It reduces computational complexity
d. It simplifies the algorithm

**14. How do you choose the value of K (the number of neighbours to consider) in the KNN algorithm?**
a. A small value of K (e.g., K=1) will result in a more flexible model but may be prone to overfitting. A large value of K will result in a more stable model but may not capture local variations.
